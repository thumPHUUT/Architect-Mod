# Architect-Mod
This is a custom character mod for Risk of Rain 2 made using the HenryTutorial community template. Do note that this build only works on Devotion update version of the game
If you wish to try this for yourself, download the mod using a mod manager (preferably r2modman) and import as a local mod. This is not uploaded on thunderstore as I am yet to have it working for current patch. 
For those who dont know, this issue was caused when the RoR2 franchise was sold to Gearbox, who erroniously updated the entire game codebase, (initially) causing major game-breaking bugs and mod incompatability. Because of this, I am not sure if I ever will have this mod working again.

To reiterate, this mod must be played on Devotion update versions of the game. Detailed tutorials on downpatching to this update can be found here:
